      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;m always interested to see how other people setup their working environment or get things done. But rarely do I share my own environment. Since I&amp;#8217;m putting the effort into pushing my scripting environment publicly to github I may as well explain a bit more about some of what I&amp;#8217;ve setup.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <guid>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2015/07/17/powershell-login-as-batch-job-security-rights/</guid>
      <description>Here is a quick bit of PowerShell. It is some snippets of C# code wrapped up with PowerShell which will allow you to assign accounts to the &amp;#8216;login as batch job&amp;#8217; local security rights of a local machine. The code is no great shakes but it is a good example of how you might take some existing online code and modify to suit your needs in PowerShell. This function also compliments another script I&amp;#8217;ve released in the past for automatically scheduling PowerShell scheduled tasks rather well.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I &lt;a href=&#34;https://zacharyloeber.com/2014/01/07/exchange-20102013-database-leveling-script/&#34;&gt;tackled the challenge&lt;/a&gt; of constructing a variant of the bin packing algorithm for leveling out Exchange databases&amp;#8217; size with the least amount of mailbox migrations necessary. Since then, I&amp;#8217;ve been approached by a few people in dreadfully large environments looking for help with errors and compatibility issues around the script I released. I&amp;#8217;ve finally rounded back to this script to do it some justice.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Lync 2013: Scripting QoS Config on Edge Servers</title>
      <link>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2015/04/04/lync-2013-scripting-qos-config-on-edge-servers/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In many environments the Lync 2013 edge servers are configured in a standalone workgroup without any easy method for setting standard policies (such as GPOs). To make QoS configuration a bit less manual and error prone I&amp;#8217;ve put together this script which can be run in an administrative powershell prompt. It will update the NLA setting (or create it if it doesn&amp;#8217;t already exist), backup and prompt for removal any existing Qos settings, then import the registry settings for Audio, Video, and App QoS settings as defined in the script parameters.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had planned to purchase this book at some point but instead was pleasantly surprised by an offer from one of the authors to provide an objective review of &amp;#8216;&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Lync-Server-Cookbook-Fabrizio-Volpe-ebook/dp/B00SVBFBQS/ref=dp_kinw_strp_1&#34;&gt;Lync Server Cookbook&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#8216;! As I have worked with the product in some form since LCS/OCS days I believe I can speak with some authority on subject matter and readily agreed. With that being said, lets start with the book&amp;#8217;s overarching scope and structure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exchange Mailbox Auditing with Powershell</title>

      <guid>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2014/11/24/exchange-mailbox-auditing-with-powershell/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;Some time ago I wrote a script and GUI for performing security audits of Exchange mailbox and calendar rights in an environment. This script was far more popular than I anticipated and, I’m ashamed to say, was rather poorly written by my current Powershell standards. There is an obvious need to simplify the extraction of mailbox permissions or my old script would not still be so popular. So I’ve started to revisit my old code for this project in hopes of remaking it with my PowerShell reporting engine. The first step in this process is to pull out the several bits of code that do the actual rights/permissions extraction. I think I’ve finally got this part done and see no reason not to release this mini-library of functions first.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve been working on an Exchange/Lync voice deployment lately and have found a new level of frustration for the lack of connectivity between the several voice components involved in turning up such a solution. That being said it is not very difficult to validate your deployment with a bit of Powershell.
There are a few necessary results to gather where I believe it can be easy to &amp;#8216;miss&amp;#8217; configuration steps when turning up or disabling users:</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Use this powershell script to gather installed features and roles from remote systems. This uses two wmi classes in an attempt to gather as much information as possible. Win32_ServerFeature will contain roles and their dependencies on systems running Windows 2008 and above. For these systems we can use this hierarchy to also produce pretty diagrams using graphviz and techniques I&amp;#8217;ve exhibited in some of my other scripts (I added this last part in cause it is easy to do, not really certain how useful it is other than maybe exploring the dependencies between windows roles/features).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In Lync 2013 you are given a powerful new backend redundancy option for your important databases in the form of SQL mirroring. In this article I’ll discuss which services are able to be mirrored, the databases they encompass, and provide a PowerShell script to generate a report on the database mirror status. I also threw in Lync CMS replication and service status sections because it is the civil thing to do&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This function uses multiple runspaces with along with COM objects to gather information about the scheduled tasks of remote systems. Getting this to work with alternate credentials may be possible but I wasn’t able to discern a usable method to make it happen so I resorted to PSremoting. What this means is that this script will work against multiple remote systems which do not have psremoting enabled as long as you are running the script with an account that has administrative rights to them. If you do pass a credential to the function then psremoting will be used instead. You can also force psremoting to be used if you are using that across the board in your environment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a quick tip which applies to more than just Lync. I use powershell with .NET ADSI to gather a list of all users which are disabled but still have Lync sip addresses assigned. There are numerous reasons to disable lync on such accounts. One reason would be to make certain that users whom are no longer with the organization get removed from the Lync address list. Another is so these same users can no longer access Lync! (Yes, a disabled AD account may still be authorized to access Lync).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put together a function for remotely gathering Windows disk information. This was specifically written to accommodate alternate credentials. This script also accounts for the glaring disconnect between win32_Volume and win32_DiskDrive within WMI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most within the messaging and collaboration industry are hyped up about the next wave of Microsoft collaboration and messaging products which are soon to be released. Among these products is Exchange 2013 RTM. This type of release typically precedes yet another wave of architecture upgrades across the corporate landscape. Some of these (beta testers) will be will undoubtedly upgrade to Exchange 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other corporations will start to feel the burn to upgrade as well. These will be organizations which realize that their Exchange &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2007&lt;/sub&gt; infrastructure is nearing a decade old existence and cannot meet the demands of their ever growing mobile workforce. Realizing they are behind the curve, they may feel hastened to upgrade as well, possibly just to Exchange 2010. Regardless the reason in choosing to upgrade their messaging infrastructure, there are critical design decisions which need to be made in how clients access this infrastructure both internally and externally. This article focuses solely on the external access aspect of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Some items listed are not really a best practice, but rather something which you may find in an environment which should be rectified (as part of an audit perhaps).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into an interesting Exchange &lt;sup&gt;2010&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2007&lt;/sub&gt; co-existence issue today. After a new Exchange 2010 (all-in-one) server was introduced into the environment traffic would only flow from the 2010 server to the 2007 hub/cas server and not the other way around. The mail queues stated the last error to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;“Initial error: 451 4.4.0 dns query failed. The error was: SMTPsend.dns.nonexistentdomain; nonexistent”&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;During my many years of working with active directory I’ve used several tools. Here are some of the best that I’ve used which are not baked into windows. Good thing about this list is that most of these tools are fee! Another bonus is that most of the information gathering tools don’t require elevated rights as, by default, domain users have read-only access to active directory.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I ran into this issue recently. End users experienced a red splat in communicator exhibiting that there was an issue syncing the corporate address book. I found &lt;a title=&#34;OCS 2007 R2 CRL Issue&#34; href=&#34;http://blog.danovich.com.au/2009/11/04/office-communicator-error-cannot-synchronize-address-book/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;this excellent article&lt;/a&gt; explaining how an invalid Certificate Revocation List error may be causing this issue. My issue was slightly similar in nature but with some caveats.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exchange 2010 (SP1): Pre-Deployment Tips</title>
      <link>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2010/12/17/exchange-2010-sp1-pre-deployment-tips/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I recently had the opportunity to experience all of the blood, sweat, and tears of migrating a minimally maintained Exchange 2003 infrastructure to Exchange 2010 (and mid-way through, an upgrade to 2010 SP1). All of the docs out on the web for migrations make it seem soooo easy. But if you are going to do anything other than a single server install and are doing things like, oh say; hardware load balancing, Exchange 2003 co-existence, or working in an old multi-domain forest then you are in for some punishment. I think I ran into every possible issue that you can have with an Exchange 2010 migration. One guide that helped me in this endeavor was the &lt;a title=&#34;Rapid Exchange 2003 to 2010 Transition Guide&#34; href=&#34;http://msexchangegeek.com/2010/01/30/rapid-transition-guide-from-exchange-2003-to-exchange-2010/&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;rapid transition guide from Exchange 2003 to Exchange 2010&lt;/a&gt;. This guide didn&amp;#8217;t cover every aspect for me though, here are a few things that may save you a little bit of hassle. I&amp;#8217;ve been meaning to publish this for a while and I have a whole lot more notes from this experience but this is a start.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

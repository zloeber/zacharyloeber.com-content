      <description>I&amp;#8217;ve delved into Windows Subsystem for Linux recently and wrote an article on the topic here. Included is a script to automatically install your chosen WSL ditribution. Check it out!</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Just the other day Microsoft released PowerShell as open source with builds available for Windows, Mac OSX, and a few flavors of Linux. I’m pretty certain the entire community is super hyped at the news. I know I am!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Create Your Own Network Assessment Appliance: Additional Tools</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I &lt;a href=&#34;https://zacharyloeber.com/2012/04/08/create-your-own-network-assessment-appliance/&#34; title=&#34;Create your own network assessment appliance&#34;&gt;previously did a write up&lt;/a&gt; on a personal virtual machine I like to keep at hand for performing network analysis and discovery. I&amp;#8217;ve since added a few tools to the VM and documented how they were installed so I figured I&amp;#8217;d share on how it was done. Even if you don&amp;#8217;t setup everything in this post it may be worthwhile to glance through it for some network engineering tools which are free to setup and use but not highly publicized. Anyone who cares to read this post has likely heard of Solarwinds but I highly doubt you have heard of all the tools in this list (let alone how to set them up). Regardless, I&amp;#8217;ll start with a tool anyone worth their salt has heard of though, Cacti&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exchange – The State Of External Client Access</title>
      <link>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2012/11/22/exchange-the-state-of-external-client-access/</link>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most within the messaging and collaboration industry are hyped up about the next wave of Microsoft collaboration and messaging products which are soon to be released. Among these products is Exchange 2013 RTM. This type of release typically precedes yet another wave of architecture upgrades across the corporate landscape. Some of these (beta testers) will be will undoubtedly upgrade to Exchange 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other corporations will start to feel the burn to upgrade as well. These will be organizations which realize that their Exchange &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2007&lt;/sub&gt; infrastructure is nearing a decade old existence and cannot meet the demands of their ever growing mobile workforce. Realizing they are behind the curve, they may feel hastened to upgrade as well, possibly just to Exchange 2010. Regardless the reason in choosing to upgrade their messaging infrastructure, there are critical design decisions which need to be made in how clients access this infrastructure both internally and externally. This article focuses solely on the external access aspect of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In this write-up I setup several network assessment tools which can be used in the discovery process of a new environment. This can be useful for a newly hired sysadmin or a consultant in rapidly gathering information to assess the health and/or state of a network.
Introduction I often find myself assessing a foreign network infrastructure for performance or other issues. Depending on the size of the environment, digesting everything can be daunting without the help of some third party tools.</description>

      <title>Linux: Headless Ubuntu Torrent Home Server</title>
      <link>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2011/09/11/linux-headless-ubuntu-torrent-home-server/</link>

      <guid>https://zacharyloeber.com/blog/2011/09/11/linux-headless-ubuntu-torrent-home-server/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;So it got to that time of the year where I feel the itch to upgrade my aging home server. I assessed the situation and realized that, for what it does, my current server does not need any kind of hardware upgrade. So I just decided to rebuild it with Ubuntu 11.04 64 bit and change up the server software a bit to be more accessible to my wife as well as to be a bit more modern (torrentflux and derivatives have been dead for a while now).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

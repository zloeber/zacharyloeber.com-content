      <description>&lt;p&gt;I found myself subjected to the commuting lifestyle again for a recent Lync 2010 deployment I&amp;#8217;ve been working on. I realized that after several months without commuting that I had forgotten just how funny it is to experience the commuter&amp;#8217;s lifestyle. So I&amp;#8217;m continuing my Chicago Commuting Dictionary so that others may be able to understand this weird weird world should they find themselves within it&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Pretty Train&lt;/strong&gt; – In my previous definition I described the extremely early, zombie-warrior-commuter filled  &lt;a title=&#34;Ugly Train&#34; href=&#34;https://zacharyloeber.com/?p=146&#34; target=&#34;_self&#34;&gt;Ugly Train&lt;/a&gt;. You will be surprised to find out that not even two hours after the ugly train takes its passengers towards their daily penance of work and suffering, a diatonic opposite happy transport on rails totes its gleeful passengers to and from the exact same locations. This, my friends, is the pretty train!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I think that commuting is starting to drive me a bit crazy. I&amp;#8217;m going to vent a bit in the form of a dictionary of what I&amp;#8217;ve noticed in the last 2 years working in the city. I&amp;#8217;ll start with train types. There are a few kinds of trains that a Chicago commuter can take and I have a name for all of them. Today we are going to talk about the appropriately named &amp;#8220;Ugly Train&amp;#8221;.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

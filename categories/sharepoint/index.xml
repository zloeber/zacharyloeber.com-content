      <description>&lt;p&gt;While specing out a Sharepoint 2007 to 2010 migration I discovered that the default monitor created by the application template on our big-ip LTM load balancers does not work. In seeking a solution I ran across this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thef5guy.com/blog/2010/08/sharepoint-2010-ntlm-and-big-ip-health-monitors/#more-1070&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gentleman&amp;#8217;s blog with a custom external monitor&lt;/a&gt; but found that it didn&amp;#8217;t really work. The solution to make it work was simple (as I explained on his blog in a comment). I went ahead and extended it to be more environment generic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

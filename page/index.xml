      <description>This site is a collection of some of the things that I&amp;#8217;m working on put in &amp;#8220;How To&amp;#8221; format to possibly assist others. In reality, most of the posted items here are an attempt to document things I&amp;#8217;ve already done some time ago and might need to do again in the future. Most of what you find on this site will be technology related. I believe strongly that what makes a good IT person is the ability to find the right tool for a situation.</description>

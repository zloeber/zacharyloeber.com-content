      <description>&lt;p&gt;Visualizing an Azure deployment can be a bit tricky. This short Azure summary script is a good way to start though.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Powershell: System Report Script Design</title>
      <link>https://.zacharyloeber.com/blog/2014/10/09/powershell-system-report-script-design/</link>

      <guid>https://.zacharyloeber.com/blog/2014/10/09/powershell-system-report-script-design/</guid>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this post I go back and explain some of my reasoning behind decisions I made in the design of an already released script, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Excel-and-HTML-Asset-0ffbf569&#34;&gt;Get-AssetReport&lt;/a&gt;. This was written over a year ago and forgotten about as one of the many unpublished drafts on my blog. The code behind the script I discuss has been upgraded and used in several of my more popular scripts (&lt;a href=&#34;https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Active-Directory-Audit-7754a877&#34;&gt;AD Asset Report&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Big-IP-F5-LTM-Load-3fc9a2af&#34;&gt;F5 LTM Report&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Lync-2013-Mirrored-SQL-132c2f06&#34;&gt;Lync 2013 Status Report&lt;/a&gt;). Some of this content is slightly dated as I&amp;#8217;ve since changed some of the coding but the core concepts are the same. Those digging through my crazy work or learning powershell may get some value from this content so I tidied it up a bit and here it is. Cheers!&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;There are more than a few QoS settings in Lync 2013. Here is a script which should gather most of them in a human readable format for your convenience.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is my third and final major update to my AD auditing script. This includes a handful of new useful sections such as domain published printers, NPS servers, DHCP servers, as well as SCCM sites and DPs. Other improvements include easier to use script parameters and bug fixes.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here is a script I whipped up to perform a report on your Big-IP LTM load balancers using powershell. The report currently includes the virtual servers, pools, and various bits of status information on both. &lt;a href=&#34;https://devcentral.f5.com/d/microsoft-powershell-with-icontrol&#34;&gt;Big-IP iControl modules&lt;/a&gt; are needed (for obvious reasons).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I put together a function for remotely gathering Windows disk information. This was specifically written to accommodate alternate credentials. This script also accounts for the glaring disconnect between win32_Volume and win32_DiskDrive within WMI.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;If you upgrade Exchange in a co-existence scenario (you want to keep the same client access namespace) there is one crucial moment of truth which must be overcome. This is the phase of the migration I&amp;#8217;ve come to call the &amp;#8220;dns flip-over&amp;#8221; or the &amp;#8220;client access part&amp;#8221;. Without preparation this part of the migration can be a real headache as issues are directly experienced by your end users.  This is a simple report card you can use to prepare you for this moment.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

&lt;p&gt;Soon I’ll be starting a new position with a company which produces some of the highest quality products in their industry. The company’s products are of such high quality that they typically set the bar in their industry. This made me think of what a truly comprises an excellent solution within the Information Technology.  This article is a non-technical personal view of what defines the “Best of breed” technical solutions.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

I&amp;#8217;ve since added a few tools to the VM and documented how they were installed so I figured I&amp;#8217;d share on how it was done. Even if you don&amp;#8217;t setup everything in this post it may be worthwhile to glance through it for some network engineering tools which are free to setup and use but not highly publicized. Anyone who cares to read this post has likely heard of Solarwinds but I highly doubt you have heard of all the tools in this list (let alone how to set them up). Regardless, I&amp;#8217;ll start with a tool anyone worth their salt has heard of though, Cacti&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Exchange – The State Of External Client Access</title>

      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;introduction&#34;&gt;Introduction&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Most within the messaging and collaboration industry are hyped up about the next wave of Microsoft collaboration and messaging products which are soon to be released. Among these products is Exchange 2013 RTM. This type of release typically precedes yet another wave of architecture upgrades across the corporate landscape. Some of these (beta testers) will be will undoubtedly upgrade to Exchange 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other corporations will start to feel the burn to upgrade as well. These will be organizations which realize that their Exchange &lt;sup&gt;2003&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;frasl;&lt;sub&gt;2007&lt;/sub&gt; infrastructure is nearing a decade old existence and cannot meet the demands of their ever growing mobile workforce. Realizing they are behind the curve, they may feel hastened to upgrade as well, possibly just to Exchange 2010. Regardless the reason in choosing to upgrade their messaging infrastructure, there are critical design decisions which need to be made in how clients access this infrastructure both internally and externally. This article focuses solely on the external access aspect of the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I just ran across &lt;a href=&#34;http://blogs.technet.com/b/nexthop/archive/2011/12/07/useful-tips-for-testing-your-lync-edge-server.aspx&#34; title=&#34;Useful Tips For Testing Your Lync Edge Server&#34;&gt;a Lync article&lt;/a&gt; with all kinds of nice tables which distilled the myriad of DNS/IP addresses in a Lync deployment down to an easy to read format. I happen to have created one of these tables myself for a Lync deployment which included a standard Lync pool, XMPP gateway, Lync Mobility, and a single edge server. I figured others may find some use from it as it auto-populates the dns entries and what they are supposed to point to based on what you fill out for the highlighted cells. Sure you get some of this in the Lync Server 2010 Planning Tool but this offers a slightly different view of the environment as well as a nice one page overview.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>In this write-up I setup several network assessment tools which can be used in the discovery process of a new environment. This can be useful for a newly hired sysadmin or a consultant in rapidly gathering information to assess the health and/or state of a network.
Introduction I often find myself assessing a foreign network infrastructure for performance or other issues. Depending on the size of the environment, digesting everything can be daunting without the help of some third party tools.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#8217;ve migrated DNS servers more than a few times and find that I&amp;#8217;m doing the same tasks or using the same custom scripts over and over again. Here is my quick and dirty task list with some powershell scripts you too might find of use. As there are a hundred ways to skin this cat I don&amp;#8217;t claim my methods to be the best but they sure are fast and far easier than manually changing a dns address on hundreds of servers, workstations, and network devices.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had always been of the mindset that when provisioning new VMs it is best to start out with less vCPUs and add more as they are required (unless you specifically know that you will be using and needing more for such things as sql server or exchange). I had even recently felt some vindication of this provisioning best practice in reading a book recently (&lt;a href=&#34;http://www.amazon.com/Critical-VMware-Mistakes-Should-Avoid/dp/1937061981&#34; title=&#34;Critical VMware Mistakes You Should Avoid&#34;&gt;Critical VMware Mistakes You Should Avoid&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/p&gt;</description>

After a new Exchange 2010 (all-in-one) server was introduced into the environment traffic would only flow from the 2010 server to the 2007 hub/cas server and not the other way around. The mail queues stated the last error to be&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;pre&gt;“Initial error: 451 4.4.0 dns query failed. The error was: SMTPsend.dns.nonexistentdomain; nonexistent”&lt;/pre&gt;</description>

      <description>Here are a few quick powershell one-liners to get all the network interface information in your exchange environment:
$ExchServers=(Get-ExchangeServer); @(foreach ($Srv in $ExchServers) {Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter IPEnabled=TRUE -ComputerName $Srv.Name | select @{Name=&#34;Server&#34;;Expression={$Srv.Name}},@{Name=&#34;DNS Host Name&#34;;Expression={$_.DNSHostName}},@{Name=&#34;Server Role&#34;;Expression={$Srv.ServerRole}},Description,@{Name=&#34;IP Address&#34;;Expression={$_.IPAddress}},@{Name=&#34;IP Subnet&#34;;Expression={$_.IPSubnet}},@{Name=&#34;Default Gateway&#34;;Expression={$_.DefaultIPGateway}},@{Name=&#34;Mac Address&#34;;Expression={$_.MacAddress}},@{Name=&#34;DNS Suffix Search Order&#34;;Expression={$_.DNSDomainSuffixSearchOrder}},@{Name=&#34;DNS Server Search Order&#34;;Expression={$_.DNSServerSearchOrder}},FullDNSRegistrationEnabled}) |Export-Csv -NoTypeInformation &#34;C:\Temp\Exchange-network.csv&#34; If you just want interface information for Exchange 2010 servers:
$ExchServers=(Get-ExchangeServer | where {$_.ServerRole -ne &#34;None&#34;}); @(foreach ($Srv in $ExchServers) {Get-WmiObject -Class Win32_NetworkAdapterConfiguration -Filter IPEnabled=TRUE -ComputerName $Srv.</description>

      <description>I figured I&amp;#8217;d post the massive table of firewall rules I compiled for my Exchange 2010 firewall generation script. It has both the source and destination roles for many aspects of an Exchange environment. Where there are ???&amp;#8217;s is where I&amp;#8217;m simply not certain (mainly around encryption between certain roles). If anyone spots any mistakes or omissions please let me know and I&amp;#8217;ll update the accordingly.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A single, or even a dual site Exchange 2010 deployment does not usually require too much internal firewall manipulation. But if you have to setup a Exchange 2010 environment where there are many global sites or a heavily segmented network, the number of firewall requests required to get a fully functioning configuration working can be daunting. Wouldn&amp;#8217;t it be nice to have some of those firewall rules automatically generated for you?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

With a login account you can access this tool at the aptly named URL of http://ihealth.f5.com. This has some really cool info that you might fine useful in resolving load balancer issues in your environment.</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Much of my time is spend delving into the minutia of a particular technology to resolve issues or improve department processes. But sometimes understanding and implementing a technology is not the best “fix” for an issue. Sometimes it is a mindset or a model that needs to change. I came up with this security grouping model to address some of the pains of managing permissions across large groups of systems in our environment. Ok, I modified a long standing Microsoft recommendation of &lt;a href=&#34;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AGDLP&#34;&gt;AGDLP (an abbreviation of &amp;#8220;account, global, domain local, permission&amp;#8221;)&lt;/a&gt; to meet our needs. Regardless here is a quick rundown of this security group model I devised if anyone is interested.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In working on a production issue with my company&amp;#8217;s flagship SaaS product I worked with some of the brilliant F5 engineers to isolate one web server in the load balanced pool which was intermittently failing. The F5 engineer recommended a health monitor that does more than just poll for a static page. He suggested we implement some kind of soap call to make the application pool do some work and return a result (I guess in case the IIS application pool is misbehaving but not down). So I worked with one of our developers to do just that but ran into some caveats which required yet another custom health monitor.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;While specing out a Sharepoint 2007 to 2010 migration I discovered that the default monitor created by the application template on our big-ip LTM load balancers does not work. In seeking a solution I ran across this &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.thef5guy.com/blog/2010/08/sharepoint-2010-ntlm-and-big-ip-health-monitors/#more-1070&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34;&gt;gentleman&amp;#8217;s blog with a custom external monitor&lt;/a&gt; but found that it didn&amp;#8217;t really work. The solution to make it work was simple (as I explained on his blog in a comment). I went ahead and extended it to be more environment generic.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

Thank goodness I setup a highly redundant load balanced farm of front end servers as the first server updated immediately had issues with the front-end services starting. Wow, updates strike again (other stories forthcoming soon, I promise).&lt;/p&gt;</description>

It is a quick script to automate the process of creating and assigning permissions for the shares needed in the front end server installation. I wrote it pretty quickly so use at your own discretion of course. Save as a .cmd or .bat and run directly on the front end server.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I had the pleasure of doing an F5 BIG-IP load balancer upgrade recently and am happy with the way the F5 people have designed their systems for fail over. Essentially you will use different system partitions to host different versions of their product and you change which one you want to boot to after updating the inactive partition. This, theoretically, means you can always go back to a working configuration if something goes awry. I&amp;#8217;m unhappy with how fragmented their documentation is in getting from point A to point B though. Here is a quick rundown of what I had to do&amp;#8230;&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here are a few scripts that I have cobbled together over the last few years. They are small and useful but nothing earth-shattering. One gets information about a remote system and who is logged in. The other can remotely reset the administrator password. Both obviously require  you have the permissions to do so on the remote machines. Both accept multiple computer names divided by a semi-colon.  Save and change the extension from .txt to .hta&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;On a headless server that you have at home or for testing I like to make sure that all security updates and trivial updates are done automatically. A good sys admin will shy away from this practice for a good reason, updates can mess things up. In a production environment or where the server setup is very complex I can understand the need to manually run updates. For me, well I&amp;#8217;m lazy when it comes to my home machines and generally don&amp;#8217;t have too complex of setups. Also, in my experience, I&amp;#8217;ve hardly ever seen an apt security or trivial update cause any harm (desktop linux I have seen issues though). That being said, I like to force security and trivial updates to happen daily.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As promised here is the post regarding choosing and using an IOS image that will fit your study needs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you followed the first post in this series you are technically now ready to start loading up images and making labs of your own. You will need to get your hands on some IOS images (legally of course).But which IOS should you use?&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;GNS3 is a frontend for dynagen (which is a scripting language for dynamips). Getting it to work nicely in Ubuntu was a bit of a pain in the arse but I was able to get it to work in a manner I&amp;#8217;m happy with. This setup will essentially encapsulate a large portion of the install to one directory in /opt. Some libraries and executables will be installed through apt though, but not many. I previously wrote part of a writeup for this on Ubuntu 7.10, I&amp;#8217;d ignore that in favor of this one which is much more up to date and polished.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As you may or may not know there are a lot of people who seem to be interested in the torrent activities of others. Some just like to track, others are government agencies, and of course the RIAA. I personally don&amp;#8217;t like this intrusion into my habits so I do my best to block their attempts. In this small tutorial I&amp;#8217;m going to cover how to install torrentflux with ipblock and fail2ban in a headless mode so you can download and seed torrents a bit more securely.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I did not want this to be my first post but it needs to be posted out there somewhere for all to read.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of documents out there on how to seize the FSMO roles in a windows 2003 domain controller, so I&amp;#8217;ll not discuss how that is done. But many of them do not tell you a few extra steps needed if you are moving the PDC Emulator role and that server is (as it should be by default&lt;/p&gt;</description>

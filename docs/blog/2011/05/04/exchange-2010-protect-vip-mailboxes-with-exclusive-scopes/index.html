        <p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Prior to starting my new job I wanted to ensure that my previous employer was able to protect VIP mailboxes in their Exchange 2010 SP1 organization. I had to do this with exclusive scopes and these are the steps I had to follow. A general knowledge of role based security is assumed in this post.</p>

<p>First we create the &#8220;Protected Exec Users&#8221; exclusive scope. When the exclusive scope is created, all users are immediately blocked from modifying the recipients that match the exclusive scope until the scope is associated with a management role assignment. If other role assignments are associated with other exclusive scopes that match the same recipients, those assignments can still modify the recipients.  Note that this scope will not appear in ECP so all assignment is done via powershell only.</p>

<p>The exclusive scope includes all users that contain the string &#8220;VIP&#8221; in CustomAttribute1 in a recipient filter. I chose CustomAttribute1 as it really is only exposed on the exchange side of things (aka. Not in ADUC) so it is not as easy or obvious to subvert by removing the property.</p>

<pre>New-ManagementScope -Name "Protected VIP Users" -RecipientRestrictionFilter { CustomAttribute1 -eq 'VIP' } -Exclusive</pre>

<p>I had initially thought I could just create a universal group in AD and then use that to assign the Mail Recipient rights to the exclusive scope. But that will not work, you must create the group within Exchange and then you can assign it an exclusive scoped role.</p>

<p>So first setup a new “Role Group” which will contain users which you will be allowing to modify modify high profile, executive mailboxes.</p>

<pre>New-RoleGroup -Name "VIP Mailbox Administrators" -Roles "Mail Recipients"</pre>

<p>The exclusive scope is then associated with a “Management Role Assignment” that assigns the Mail Recipients management role to the role group we just created.</p>

<pre>New-ManagementRoleAssignment -Name "VIP Mailbox Administrators" -SecurityGroup "VIP Mailbox Administrators" -Role "Mail Recipients" -ExclusiveRecipientWriteScope "Protected VIP Users"</pre>

<p>Once this is done, anyone who is not within the VIP Mailbox Administrators role group will be denied access from updating information on the mailbox.</p>

<p>This does not fully protect your VIP mailboxes if an appropriate role delegation model is absent from your plan.</p>

<p>You will want to create Exchange Role Groups with least privilege role assignment for different people in your organization. You don’t want someone to just be able to create a transport rule that bcc’s them on all email to a VIP mailbox for instance. Or be able to setup a journaling rule that can siphon sensitive information to another mailbox.</p>

<p>Some of the roles you will need to limit access to would be:</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Journaling
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Message Tracking
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Retention Management
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Transport Rules
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Legal Hold
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Mailbox Search
</p>

<p style="padding-left: 30px;">
  Role Management
</p>

<p>All of these roles can grant permission that a savvy person could use to get email subversively. Obviously limit the membership of the organizational management role group. If you are removing yourself from this group to hand the reigns of control to your boss (to eat your own dog food and prove you don’t need the keys to the castle to do your job), be certain that your admin account is in all the other role groups you need it to be in ahead of time.</p>

<p>To fine-grain tweak how these are assigned in exchange 2010 sp1 I recommend <a href="http://rbac.codeplex.com/">RBAC Editor GUI</a>. It really gives some good insight on the capabilities which each role is able to perform (all the way down to the associated powershell commands).</p>

<p>Finally, if a technician has the ability to add themselves to any group within AD then all of this setup will have been meaningless. Ways to mitigate AD risk will be something I bring up in a future post. If you are running a near empty root forest and have your exchange organization in a sub-domain of the forest you shouldn’t have too much to worry about though.</p>

<p>Some other roles which may be assigned to role groups are listed for your reference are listed below.</p>

      <description>This site is a collection of some of the things that I’m working on put in “How To” format to possibly assist others. In reality, most of the posted items here are an attempt to document things I’ve already done some time ago and might need to do again in the future. Most of what you find on this site will be technology related. I believe strongly that what makes a good IT person is the ability to find the right tool for a situation.</description>
